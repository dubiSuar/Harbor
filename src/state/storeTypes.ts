/**
 * CONTRACT CHANGES (data-layer review fixes), for the UI:
 *
 * - NEW `followingState: LoadState` / `followingError?: string`. Until
 *   followingState is 'ready' the `following` map is incomplete:
 *   disable Follow / Following buttons, and show followingError when
 *   it is 'error'. toggleFollow() rejects while it is not 'ready'.
 * - NEW `activityState: LoadState` / `activityError?: string`, so the
 *   Activity screen can show a loading / error state instead of an empty
 *   list.
 * - NEW `FeedSummary.period: 'today' | 'week'`. When nothing was posted
 *   since local midnight, the summary covers the last 7 days instead. Render
 *   "N posts today" or "N posts this week". Hide the card only when
 *   count === 0 (both windows empty).
 * - CHANGED `loadMore()` now REJECTS with a user-facing Error on failure
 *   (it no longer sets feedError). Show it as a toast.
 * - CHANGED feedState / feedError also report a failed profile setup:
 *   feedState 'error' with "Couldn't set up your profile. Check your
 *   connection and try again."; refreshFeed() retries it.
 * - REMOVED `Prefs.privateAccount` (it was never enforced). Drop the
 *   "Private account" switch from Settings.
